web-based interactive development enviroment
supports rich text element
most popular -jupyter notebook(it dont want internet)

variables:-
variables names can have letters ,numbers and undercores
cannot start with numbers
-eg: 1_student,
spaces are not allowed
Name s should be short and descriptive
cannot use python functions /keywords
like elif,if,import,def,true,none,etc...
example:-
          message="hello world"
          print(message)
  
 when we make a mistake in the prg the prg shows "traceback"
   **** the python will use the current data for the same variable *****   
   example
   message="hello"
   message="hii"
   print(message)
   //answer will be hii (becoz it is a updated one)
